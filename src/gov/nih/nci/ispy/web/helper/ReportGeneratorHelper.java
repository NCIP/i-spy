/**
 * The ReportGeneratorHelper was written to act as a Report Generation manager

 * execute or the cache key to a previously stored Resultant, the necesary calls
 * are made to generate an XML document representing the report. The generated
 * XML will then be stored in a ReportBean that will also contain the cache key
 * where the resultant can be called again, if needed.
