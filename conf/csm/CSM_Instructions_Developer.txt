Developer Steps for setting up CSM locally: (updated 10/03/06 by: Kevin Rosso)
************************************
1. If this is the first time you are using csm for login security, please read carefully...
   In the current release of csm, the following 2 files are bundled with the application.
   -ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml
   -oracle-ds.xml
   These 2 files are both located at \api\src\resources\
   For csm to function, ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml is to be copied to 
   C:\devtools\jboss-4.0.2\server\default\conf in your JBOSS installation and
   oracle-ds.xml is to be copied to C:\devtools\jboss-4.0.2\server\default\deploy.
   However, when working with this build script, this step is unecessary as the ant build
   will carry out this task for you. So, do not add the provided templates for these
   2 files into their respective JBOSS directories if this is your first time using
   csm. If you already have csm running with these files, just quickly check the files
   to make sure they are both well-formed xml. 
   
************************************

2. In buildCSM.properties, make sure that you set the following properties
   custom to your workstation AND specific project if you do not already have
   CSM implemented. The following shows "example" values:
	  
	 -project_name=ispy
	 -jboss.install.dir=C:/jboss-4.0.2
	 -build.deploy.lib.dir=lib
	 -jboss.install.dir=C:/devtools/jboss/jboss-4.0.2/
	 -jboss.server.name=default
	 -csm.jndi.connection.datasource=ispycsm
	 -urlDbalias=something:@server2-d.nci.nih.gov:port:ANAME
     -databaseUser=USER_NAME
     -databasePassword=pa$$word
     -jdbcRuntimeDriver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
     -ldap.initial.context.factory=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
     -ldap.provider.url=ldaps://some.server.name:999
     -ldap.security.authentication=simple
     -ldap.security.protocol=ssl
     -ldap.context=ou=nci,o=nih
	 
 
************************************
  
3. Run the target "copyNeededFiles" (which is also the default)

************************************

4. This step may not be necessary for all developers. PLEASE READ:
   Look in the file named properties-services.xml. Look for an entry
   of the following that points to the ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml
   Example:
   			<attribute name="Properties">
      				gov.nih.nci.security.configFile=C:/devtools/jboss/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/conf/ApplicationSecurityConfig.xml
			</attribute>
   If this is found, move onto the next step. If not, in the buildCSM.xml
   file, run the target, "appendPropertyService".
   
*************************************
5.  Lastly, until the CSM is upgraded you must delete the conficting folder that
	is JBoss/server/default/deploy/jboss-hibernate.deployer.

	Right now there is a conflict between the different versions of hibernate.
