Welcome to the ISPY Project!
=====================================

The I-SPY trial is a national study to identify biomarkers predictive of response to therapy throughout the treatment cycle for women with Stage 3 breast cancer. The I-SPY study is sponsored by the Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORES) and includes participation from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN). The study involves the use of a contrast-enhanced breast MRI for the evaluation of locally-advanced breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. The I-SPY study aims to correlate MRI results with molecular markers to identify the right surrogate marker for early response.

The I-SPY informatics effort involves providing informatics support for the I-SPY trial. This involves the integration, and analysis of diverse data types including clinical, MRI imaging, gene expression, Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH), and cell lysates throughout the breast cancer treatment cycle. By providing an integrative platform designed to correlate molecular data with MRI patterns, study researchers will be able to more effectively identify surrogate markers for early response which will ultimately result in more effective therapies for breast cancer patients.

To facilitate the integration and analysis of diverse data types, the NCICB caIntegrator data warehousing solution in conjunction with existing NCICB datamarts will be leveraged. caIntegrator data mining query and reporting tools will be accessible via a customized I-SPY application portal. The application portal will illustrate how research data is shared across study organizations and integrated in support of translational research.

I-SPY is an Open Source project and it is written in Java using Spring framework, Hibernate, struts, Apache Commons, caCORE CSM.
